Quick Question: If I want to install Flash 10.2 for 64-bit (in 10.10) should I uninstall Adobe Flash Player plugin installer 10.1.85.3Ubuntu1 first?
isn't 64bit flash installed by default on 10.10?
There's flashplugin64-nonfree provided by Adobe and there's an older version flashplugin-installer 10.1.85.3ubuntu1 --- Adobe just put out their 10.02 64-bit flashplugin like 3 weeks ago.

How can I see the full stacktrace of an error during boot? The system crashes afterwards so there is no way of reading the log files.
There are more than one provision. You need to install a trace program. You need to install the necessary DEB packages.
The 11.04 live cd is throwing the error during boot. I think its failing to load 'nouveau'. I'm pretty sure I cannot make any additions to the CD.

backup software always runs with sufficient privileges to read *all* files. - so run your backup software/commands as root. What's the problem in that?

Can I install ati nvidia and intel drivers so I will have 3d acceleration on any pc I use it on?"
not really.  The driver has to be selected in the xorg configuration file and loaded at the start of X for acceleration.  You would have to also change this file ever time you booted to a machine with a different video card.
yes.  I have a stick I have that same setup on.  I avoid any support of ATI like the plague.

## Can someone answer a question please? i have 9.10 installed and am trying to add a PPA to my system. The instructions state I am supposed to just type 'sudo apt-add-repository ppa:.........' but there is no option for add-repository for apt. any thoughts?
what you said makes no sense.  Pastebin your command and the output
I miss-typed it sorry. If I type in apt-<tab twice> i get a list of options and none of them are 'add-repository'. I am not currently in front of the system as no one answered my question earlier.
hey whats the name of the website where i can post my screenshot
so i can get some help  with something

anyone know of a distribution thats as polished as ubuntu but doesn't use the lame sudo crap?
sudo protects the system from the average user yes...but it henders when trying to maintain several systems where you don't want their primary user to be able to install thing
sudo is a good user model. You can run: sudo -i    for an interactive session and you won't need to type pass till you run: exit
channel
what is the help channel?

ask your question
how do i format a usb drive? ive tried: fdisk /dev/sda1
where does ubuntu put usb drives when you put them in? /media or /dev/sda1 or soemthing?
it should automatically put them in /media/*something or other* but /dev/sd** should be the actual link to the device. depending on the the filesystem is and how you mount it; in can work almost the same as being automatically mounted upon boot.

Explain what a 'Safe delete' is for everybody so we have a better idea of what you're trying to achieve.

basically you should only install 10.10 beta if you intend to be reporting bugs.  Because you will be running into them.  If you are looking to use the system problem-free you should at least wait until a release candidate.

when the server boots up.. i get display output thru the onboard vga.. but after grub.. i get a blank screen.. so ubuntu is using the GTX card... i can login remotely to the server so i know its up.. just nothing on the display

BASH has made me loath backticks. Thanks for the tip

"Hmm, but for example. My friend set up an SSH account on his computer for me, but it always prompts me for my username first."

one could take a que from linspire possibly..they ship  with reiser4 which they 'claim' is unbreakable and they charge for their OS..if its good enough for them somehow I trust it....I use reiser4 here in hoary and ic no problems although i've not been running it for long periods yet

If thats what you're looking to get installed, you would be better asking in the #winehq channel, they would be better able to help with installing the windows version"
"I think you're more likely to get a response in winehq then, I've not heard of the software before, hopefully they'll be able to better help you"
"Hi - I have what I think is a basic question. I currently have two ubuntu versions installed on two separate partitions.

I have wdm, custom .xinitrc, compiz setup and working.  When I run 'kdesudo <program>', though, (from yakuake/konsole), compiz freezes and goes to 100% CPU (one of my two cores at a time).  I can move my mouse, but my desktop (awn, any windows, etc) is unresponsive.  I"
essentially have to go to a virtual terminal and 'pkill X' or 'killall -9 compiz' (-15 does nothing).  Any ideas why it would do that?  Using gksudo seems to work alright.
Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
how do i set up a network between a windows and ubuntu comp via a crossover cable?

Does Ubuntu still use xorg.conf? I never really got what happens there. First I thought that HAL took over what xorg-conf was orginally doing - THEN HAL was meant to be replaced DeviceKit - NOW Hal is still there - xorg.conf too - and then there are options dispersed all over the place - WHAT the hell is going on?!?
"If xorg.conf exists it will honor the settings there, otherwise it will attempt to detect automagically."
Docteh I thought HAL or soemthing like that was sposed to handle that these days

How necessary is it to run a firewall on ubuntu?
"I know that one gets instantly bombed without one on Windows, but does the same hold true for linux?"
"depends on what you use your machine for. If its a front end server, then yes a firewall is necessary. For a personal machine, I personally think its also necessary, some don't. Its just so easy to configure might as well do it. The newer linux kernels (like the one in ubuntu) come with firewall capabilities, you just have to configure them."

"I don't fear it, really... it's just that in Windows you only have to use the command line for weird reasons, like getting certain java files to open (even then, I tend to make .bat files)... in linux it's more like the GUI and the command line are on equal footing"
